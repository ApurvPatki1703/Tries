Tries
=====

This is an implementation of Trie data structure. This code is an implementation of the data structure on the lines of lecture by Robert Sedgewick's in the course Algorithms 2 on coursera. I have improved Trie using HashMap reduce memory wastage in traditional tries which is HybridTrie.java. An implementation of suffix tree which is very similar to implementation of hybrid trie is also included. These datastructures can be used in place of hashmap as they use lesser memory, in general cases. Any application that wants to make use of prefix search can use tries, hybrid tries, ternary search trees. This implementation is a map where you can put key(String), value(integer) pairs. I will soon post a generic(value) map implementation for tries family.
